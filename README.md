# JavascriptExperiments
Experiments in Javascript, mostly visual.

The particle system folder is a basic port of a particle system I made in Flash AS3 to instead run in a canvas.

Wheelproto is an attempt to recreate a Wheel of Fortune style wheel in HTML SVG.

Jschattest was a small JQuery test to attempt to make a cool sliding autoscrolling chat popup for an overlay.

StreamOverlay was what I made after testing my particle system, and kind of the reason I looked into javascript in the first place.  I was inspired by AGDQ and wanted to see if I could to some level make a much smaller scale similar kind of stream overlay, mostly to replace my old flash overlay, as flash is terrible embedded in xsplit.  I succeeded!
